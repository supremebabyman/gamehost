          So! Lets start with how GoGuardian works. For future reference, this
          is all speculation based on some trial and error.
        </a>
        <a>
          GoGuardian has a page where you can block web url's, which is usually
          how they get rid of unblocked games websites. They also have an auto
          blocker, which they use for any malicious website, they give you no
          access to it and it was as if it was blocked manually.
        </a>
        <a>
          However! There seems to be something in the middle of that when you
          download something in the browser.
        </a>
        <a>
          For this game to run, it needs to download one of its own files
          (game.unx). This doesent download anything on your side btw, its just
          for the browser.
        </a>
        <a>
          Because of this download, GoGuardian seems to think that it is a
          malicious site (rightfully so), and blocks it.
        </a>
        <a>
          Luckily for us, this block isnt permanent, and just for safety
          purposes for you to click off the site.
        </a>
        <a>
          Double luckily, this block only happens during the download, so if we
          finish downloading it, GoGuardian doesent see it as a threat anymore.
        </a>
        <a> So, what does this mean for us? </a>
        <a>
          Well, to make the download finish we are going to follow these
          instructions:
        </a>
        <h2>
          <strong>Instructions</strong>
        </h2>
        <li>
          1. Slow your school chromebook to a screeching halt. THis could be
          through 100000000 new tabs, or any other way to slow your computer
          down.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Open Pizza Tower (while you are there waiting for the download to
          finish, scroll down and open the console to make it even slower)
        </li>
        <li>3. Wait....</li>
        <li>
          4. Hopefully, GoGaurdian got slowed down enough that it did not block.
        </li>
        <h2>
          <strong>Extra Info On Instructions (important!)</strong>
        </h2>
        <li>
          Sometimes, GoGaurdian will get slowed down so hard that it blocks
          after the download has finished.
        </li>
        <li>
            I laod more than one Pizza Tower so I have backups in case the first one gets blocked.
            </li>
        <li>
          This is NOT consistent in the slightest, I have had times it was first
          try, and times it was in 40.
        </li>
        <li>
          Is this DDDoSing? No lmao, I am not doing this to steal information,
          and im not even crashing the servers, just slowing them down enough to
          play the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a sweat, you can prevent GoGaurdian from blocking it simply
          by being good at timing. When it blocks it, it redirects you to a
          different link, so if you click the X that replaces the refresh button
          just before the page loads, then it wont block it. (VERY STRICT
          TIMING, AND IT WILL TRY AGAIN EVERY SECOND, ONLY DO AS A LAST RESORT)
        </li>
        <li>
          Im gonna try to make a lag swith on the site so you dont have to open
          1 billion new tabs.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are doign this on a really bad chromebook from school, then
          when you load the game successfully, it might be laggy. But if you do
          this on one of the high end chromebooks from school, then it wont lag
          at all, but it is also way harder to prevent GoGaurdian. (high
          risk-high reward type shii)
        </li>
        <h2>
            The End
            <h2>
                <li>
                    I will try to update this as I learn more things about how it works, and also try to add images so the instructions are a bit clearer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will also add a start game button to Pizza Tower so that you can set up before it blocks it.
